# Example Documentations

Experience the ADF documentation template in full action
{: .fs-6 .fw-300}

The following examples use the ADF documentation template and model the diagrams according to the [ADF views](../views/) method.

## Example 1: What2Eat

What2Eat is a simple app for displaying the daily meals in the cafeteria of the University of Kaiserslautern. It serves as an example for architecture design (part of the lecture "SWAR-WIN: Software Architecture" by Prof. Dr. Johannes C. Schneider at HTWG Konstanz). The described system is very simple but has a scope that is architecturally already somewhat interesting (two external "systems") and relates to typical enterprise information systems (layered architecture and REST interface). The documentation is written in English.

## Example 2: Dokchess

Dokchess is a chess engine and serves as an example for an architecture documentation according to the arc42 template in Stefan ZÃ¶rner's book "Documenting and Communicating Software Architectures: Tracing and Effectively Capturing Designs, Decisions, and Solutions." In 2025, Johannes Schneider created a second version of this documentation in the format of the ADF documentation template. The textual content is largely the same, so one can compare arc42 and ADF well here. The documentation is written in German.

## Example 3: Marktplatz Deutschland.Digital

The project [Marktplatz Deutschland.Digital](https://www.deutschlanddigital.org/) (a name roughly equivalent to *Germany.Digital Marketplace*) focuses on public services in rural areas through digitalization and has developed a platform where various providers can offer digital solutions for municipalities. As part of expanding the architectural documentation of the project, the developers selected a small part of Marktplatz Deutschland.Digital to demonstrate the application of the ADF documentation template, as well as Documentation-as-code and Diagrams-as-code. The marketplace service is a Spring Boot-based REST backend with database integration, allowing the creation, publication, and retrieval of marketplace entries. The documentation is written in German.
