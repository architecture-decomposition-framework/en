**Architecture**: It's about **software architecture**, which is the set of design decisions made about a software system that affect the system as a whole.

**Decomposition**: To understand complex structures, we need to break them down. The ADF provides an **architecture documentation template** that progressively reveals various aspects and levels of detail of a system, along with corresponding **views** that allow these aspects to be modeled as diagrams.

**Framework**: This methodology is not limited to modeling specific systems. Instead, it provides a general approach that can be applied to any software system, ranging from command-line tools to microservices.
